Welcome to the development branch of the ÂµFiction v1 installer.

This will come shipped with source files from the main project, downloads from this repository should only be used if there was a bug in the release and a hotfix was announced.

To handle the beloved UTF-8 issue, the installer will attempt to convert stories that are stored as files from Windows-1252 to UTF-8. If this fails or you are using a different codepage, drop a support ticket. This does not affect imports from database.
